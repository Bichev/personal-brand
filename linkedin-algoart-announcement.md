# LinkedIn Post — AlgoArt Launch

---

Twelve algorithms. Twelve interactive canvases. Twelve articles explaining the math behind the beauty.

I built **AlgoArt** — an open collection of interactive algorithmic art pieces, each paired with an educational deep-dive into the mathematics that drives it.

The project covers reaction-diffusion (Turing, 1952), flocking behavior (Reynolds, 1986), Lorenz attractors, L-systems, Mandelbrot and Julia sets, Perlin noise flow fields, N-body gravitational simulations, Lissajous harmonographs, Voronoi tessellation, Conway's Game of Life, golden ratio spirals, and harmonic wave emergence.

Every piece runs live in the browser. Every piece has parameter controls so you can explore the algorithm's behavior space yourself. Every piece includes a full article — written for both a curious 7-year-old and a working mathematician.

**Why this matters:**

Mathematics is not abstract until someone makes it abstract. These algorithms produce leopard spots, galaxy arms, river deltas, and flock formations. The gap between "I don't get math" and "I can't stop watching this" is one well-built visualization.

When someone watches a Turing pattern form on screen and asks "how does it do that?" — that question is worth more than any textbook chapter. Before the equation, there should be the phenomenon. Before the proof, the wonder. That is what this project attempts — put the beauty first, then let curiosity drive the learning.

These pieces were designed for screens, but they belong on walls. If you run a gallery, museum, university program, or STEM event and want to bring interactive algorithmic art to your space — I'd welcome that conversation. Every piece works on any display, runs in real time, and comes with educational material ready for workshops or guided tours. Reach out.

Mentioning people and organizations whose work made this possible or relevant:

Daniel Shiffman — The Coding Train and Nature of Code are the reason a generation of developers discovered creative coding. This project wouldn't exist without that foundation.

Processing Foundation — p5.js remains one of the best tools for making computation visible and accessible.

Casey Reas, Ben Fry — Processing set the standard for what creative coding tools should be.

Stephen Wolfram — A New Kind of Science reshaped how many of us think about cellular automata and computational irreducibility.

SIGGRAPH — Craig Reynolds' 1987 Boids paper at SIGGRAPH opened the door to emergent behavior simulation in computer graphics.

Ars Electronica — Consistently demonstrating that art and technology are not separate disciplines.

Bridging Art and Science: Kavli Foundation, Exploratorium, MIT Media Lab — institutions proving that the intersection of art, math, and technology produces the deepest understanding.

Khan Academy, 3Blue1Brown (Grant Sanderson) — Setting the bar for making mathematics genuinely beautiful and accessible at scale.

**Jacksonville, FL — local organizations and people doing related work:**

MOCA Jacksonville (Museum of Contemporary Art) — UNF's contemporary art institute downtown. The only museum in Northeast Florida dedicated to contemporary art. A natural home for conversations about where computation meets visual culture.

The Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens — One of Jacksonville's cornerstone cultural institutions. Their education programs and community programming demonstrate that art access changes how people think.

Jacksonville University STEAM Institute — One of the first interdisciplinary STEAM institutes in the country, with labs spanning animation, robotics, design thinking, and engineering. Exactly the kind of institution bridging the disciplines this project lives between.

Northeast Florida STEM2 Hub — Regional organization focused on STEM and medicine education across Northeast Florida. Their K-12 programming in coding and robotics is the pipeline that projects like AlgoArt aim to feed.

Jacksonville Science Festival — Annual event bringing hands-on STEAM education to K-12 students. The kind of setting where interactive algorithmic art becomes a gateway to deeper inquiry.

Jacksonville IT Council (JITC) — The hub for Jacksonville's technology community. Their Tech Coast Conference brings together cybersecurity, fintech, robotics, and innovation professionals — the broader ecosystem that creative coding belongs to.

FSCJ (Florida State College at Jacksonville) — Hosts JITC events at their Advanced Technology Center and provides foundational tech education across the region.

University of North Florida — Home to MOCA and a growing computer science program. The intersection of a research university and a contemporary art museum on one campus is rare and worth leveraging.

Jax Code 4 Change — City of Jacksonville initiative training young people (16-21) in software development, data analytics, and AI. Mayor Donna Deegan called it "a gateway to possibilities" — algorithmic art is one of those possibilities.

Flagler College — Fine arts, graphic design, data science, and computer information systems programs in St. Augustine. A school where students studying painting sit next door to students studying algorithms — exactly the kind of place where algorithmic art makes both sides of the hallway curious.

Jax Makerspace (Jacksonville Public Library) — Downtown maker space offering 3D design, digital arts, and STEAM building programs. Public libraries remain one of the most democratic access points for creative technology.
